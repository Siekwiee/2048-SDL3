# Simple SDL3 C++ project

This is a simple SDL3 C++ project that demonstrates how to use SDL3 in a C++ project.

## Building

Cmake is kinda required when not using Visual Studio. LOL

### Game

I want to create a basic 2048 game. copied graphics from original 2048 game.

- on arrow key press, move all tiles
- if no tile moved, dont finish the action otherwise skip to next turn and spawn 1 new tile at random position
- on init spawn 2 new tiles at random position
- score is sum of all tiles
